<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>I aim to create a program for Marsden pizzas. It will be for users that are wanting to order pizzas from the menu.</p>
<h2>Initial project backlog</h2>

<h2><a id="One">Sprint One</a></h2>
<h3>Rough program plan for sprint one:</h3>

<h3>Sprint one project board in progress:</h3>

<h3>Sprint one test:</h3>
<img src="assets/img/sprint1test.png" width="60%" alt="Image of test">
<p style="padding-top: 10px;">From the image above, it shows how my sprint one is working how I had imagined and hoped
	that it would, no unexpected errors occurred. The temporary menu (I intent to add more types in the future) prints
	correctly and how I designed, the option to quit also works properly. I also added styling which printed in the way
	I intended.</p>
<h3 style="padding: 0px;"><u>Sprint review</u></h3>
<p>I believe that sprint one worked successfully and accordingly. I now have a basic menu that will run the functions
available to the user when they select what option they would like to run. I also have a basic list of pizza types, that
in future sprints, the user will be able to choose the types they would like to order. For the next sprint, I would like
to include a function that allows the user to choose whether they are going to have their order ready for pick-up or for
delivery. If this works successfully, I will then expand the program further.</p>


<h2><a id="Two">Sprint Two</a></h2>
<h3>Rough program plan for sprint two:</h3>

<img src="assets/img/sprint2test2.png" width="50%" alt="Image of test 2">
<p style="padding-top: 10px;">From the two images above, it shows how the function I have added and the dictionary is correctly working. In the
first image, I also printed out the dictionary that includes all of the users information to check if the information the
user entered, has been inserted into the dictionary in the main function (which it has). The user is also correctly asked
information that would be needed, according to their choice of either "Pick-up" or "Delivery". My styling has printed out
well and I can now pick and choose information that I would like to use in future sprints from the main dictionary.</p>
<img src="assets/img/sprint2test3.png" width="50%" alt="Image of test 3">
<p style="padding-top: 10px;">I have not yet included validation, which as shown in the image above, is needed. The user
is able to crash the program if they entered the wrong input or have a name with special characters and no there is no
maximum and minimum length. These are all aspects of validation that I would like to include in a future sprint</p>
<h3><u>Sprint review</u></h3>
<p>When going about this sprint, there were multiple ways of designing a delivery pickup function. I could have made it
with lists or individual values, but I thought that the best way to go about it was by creating a dictionary. The
dictionary includes all of the information that would be needed about the user, according to whether they are wanting
delivery or pickup. This way, if I wanted to include any personal information in future functions (like the cost), then
all that I would need to do is pass it through the function, and pick out the information I would like to use. If I had
done it a different way, then my code could get cluttered or I would need to call a range of arguments for information
that is all related. I can also easily comment out this function when I am testing and add it later to be more efficient
with my time. I think the function works well but will definitely need validation in a future sprint so my program can
handle unexpected input, I have mentioned this in my tests for this sprint. </p>


<h2><a id="Three">Sprint Three</a></h2>
<h3>Rough program plan for sprint three:</h3>

<h3>Sprint three testing:</h3>
<img src="assets/img/sprint3test1.png" width="50%" alt="Image of test 1">
<p style="padding-top: 10px;">From the image above, it shows how my function works correctly. The price adds up to the
correct one, and a separate list is made, with the users order so I can easily access it or print the order in a future
function, if the user wished to see it. I have made it so the pizza name and price from my list of pizza types is
transferred onto their order, so it remains the same name throughout my code. Pizzas can easily be put on the
users menu at any point from the main menu. It is also inclusive to those with a gluten allergy as GF bases are made
available.</p>
<img src="assets/img/sprint3test2.png" width="50%" alt="Image of test 2">
<img src="assets/img/sprint3test3.png" width="50%" alt="Image of test 3">
<p style="padding-top: 10px;">From both of these tests, it is clear that this sprint is not without faults. There are
many times in this function where a user has to enter input and there are no restrictions on it. In the first picture,
I have shown how the program crashes with an error message, this occurs if the user accidentally enters an index number
that is not included in the list of pizzas. This is not a good design currently as I definitely need to be aware that
users may make mistakes and the program should not crash because of this. In a future sprint, I hope to make validation
so this error will not occur. In the second image, it shows how there is no limit on the amount of pizzas a user can
order which is unrealistic so I aim to validate a limit. It also shows how the user could enter anything for the base
(because it is a string), so I will also need to validate that so there are only two possible inputs (plain or GF) that
will be placed in the order list. </p>
<h3><u>Sprint review</u></h3>
<p>This sprint has been successful, without any unexpected issues. I thought the best way to go about this sprint was to
have the users order go into a separate list, taking values from my pizza types list into their order, with some
additional information. The user can easily go back and re-add a different type of pizza, though another issue that I
have noticed is that if the user wanted to add another pizza of the same type, then that would create a new set of
values, over just changing the amount in the list, this will also need validation. There are many aspects that require
validation in a future sprint to avoid any mistakes or incorrect input recorded, which I mentioned in the testing. In
the next sprint, I aim to create a function that gives the user the ability to edit their ordered pizzas.</p>


<h2><a id="Four">Sprint Four</a></h2>
<h3>Rough program plan for sprint four:</h3>
<img src="assets/img/sprint4plan.jpg" width="30%" alt="Image of program plan">
<h3>Sprint four project board in progress:</h3>

<h3>Sprint four testing:</h3>
<img src="assets/img/sprint4test1.png" width="50%" alt="Image of test 1">
<p style="padding-top: 10px;">In my sprint 4 testing, you can see that my editing function has works as expected. In
this image of my first test, both aspects of editing a users order work well. A pizza is successfully removed from the
list when a user enters '0'. This is important because a user may want to remove a whole type of pizza from their order,
rather than just altering the amount on there, as mistakes are always made and should be considered. Applying this same
reasoning, a user may also want to change the amount of pizzas they have of a type, so this is also an important
piece of code.</p>
<img src="assets/img/sprint4test2.png" width="50%" alt="Image of test 2">
<img src="assets/img/sprint4test3.png" width="50%" alt="Image of test 3">
<p style="padding-top: 10px;">In these following two tests, it demonstrates how there is still many faults in the
construction of my code. As seen in my previous sprints, these errors are caused by a lack of validation throughout my
design, which I hope to improve in the future. There is currently no limit on the number of pizzas that the user can
order, which is unrealistic. A large fault is also that the program quits with an error message, if the user enters a
letter or special character, when the input is for an integer. Like the previous sprints, there is also an error
message if the user enters a value for the index numbers, that is not on the list. Through a function that I created to
print out the user's order, the order prints out correctly and with index numbers to be more clear to the user. </p>
<h3><u>Sprint review</u></h3>
<p>In this sprint, my editing function worked accordingly, I also made a few minor adjustments throughout my code to
better it. The first adjustment I made was to display the index numbers beside the pizza types in the menu and on their
order, so the index numbers are more clear to the user (which can be seen in my test). I have also removed the GF option
to my code, as I realised that it was unnecessary for the point at which my program was at, in a future I may wish to
add the addition in, once it has reached a more developed stage. This is because it made my testing difficult and
tedious, when building more important elements of my program. <br> Another adjustment I made was in how the cost works.
I created a separate function to multiply and add together the cost of the pizzas (rough code plan in sprint four plan).
This means that I can update the cost externally, so if the user wishes to change their order, the cost will correctly
be updated. I have added extras in my main dictionary, so the pizzas total can be added externally, and other costs,
like the extra cost that is added if the user wants to have a delivery order. In a future sprint, where I will create a
function to print out the users order, I will display their total cost of the pizzas, and the total cost of their extra
costs, and then add them together for their final cost. <br> My main focus in this sprint was to build the editing order
function, this gives the user the ability to change the amount of pizzas they ordered, or remove a particular type of
pizza from their order. This works successfully, and the main errors of the program is that there is no validation for
user entries, so many errors or problems can still occur, which is something I aim to change in a future sprint.</p>
