<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>I aim to create a program for Marsden pizzas. It will be for users that are wanting to order pizzas from the menu.</p>
<h2>Initial project backlog</h2>

<h2><a id="One">Sprint One</a></h2>
<h3>Rough program plan for sprint one:</h3>

<h3>Sprint one project board in progress:</h3>

<h3>Sprint one test:</h3>

<p style="padding-top: 10px;">From the image above, it shows how my sprint one is working how I had imagined and hoped
	that it would, no unexpected errors occurred. The temporary menu (I intent to add more types in the future) prints
	correctly and how I designed, the option to quit also works properly. I also added styling which printed in the way
	I intended.</p>
<h3 style="padding: 0px;"><u>Sprint review</u></h3>
<p>I believe that sprint one worked successfully and accordingly. I now have a basic menu that will run the functions
available to the user when they select what option they would like to run. I also have a basic list of pizza types, that
in future versions, the user will be able to choose the types they would like to order. For the next sprint, I would like
to include a function that allows the user to choose whether they are going to have their order ready for pick-up or for
delivery. If this works successfully, I will then expand the program further.</p>
